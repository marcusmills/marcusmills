        <h2>Interim Cloud Transformation Director</h2>
        <p>
            When cloud transformation efforts stall, budgets blow out, or governance weakens, I step in as your interim Director of Cloud Transformation. 
            My mission: restore clarity, deliver against business goals, and leave behind a robust, secure, cost-efficient cloud landscape.
        </p>

        <h3>How I Add Value</h3>

                    <td>Governance & Controls</td>
                    <td>Security, compliance, and cost guardrails to prevent drift, shadow IT, and runaway spend.</td>
